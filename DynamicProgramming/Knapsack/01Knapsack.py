"""
Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.
Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.
Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
NOTE:
You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
